# LedMapping demonstration code
This AVR code demonstrates effects that can be implemented with registered LEDS. For now, this code uses
hard-coded LED positions that were obtained by running the OpenCV LedMapping code on a video sequence. These positions will not
work on any other setup that the one that was used in this particular video.
